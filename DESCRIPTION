Author: Babatunde Alli
Maintainer: Babatunde Alli <babatunde.alli@mail.mcgill.ca>
Description: Produces a publication-ready table that includes all 
    effect estimates neccessary for full reporting effect modification 
    or interaction analysis as recommended by Knol and Vanderweele (2012) [< https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyr218 >]. It also estimates confidence interval for 
    the trio of additive interaction measures using the delta method (see Hosmer and Lemeshow (1992), [< https://doi.org/10.1097/00001648-199209000-00012 >]), 
    variance recovery method (see Zou (2008), [< https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwn104 >]), or bootstrapping (see Assmann et al. (1996), [< https://doi.org/10.1097/00001648-199605000-00012 >] ).
